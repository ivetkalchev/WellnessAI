# WellnessAI

WellnessAI is a machine learning project that aims to predict sleep quality and stress levels based on daily habits such as exercise, caffeine intake, screen time and work hours. The goal is to provide actionable insights for optimising routines and improving overall well-being.

## Project Structure

The repository consists of the following two main folders:

### 1. `dataset/`
This folder contains the data used for training and evaluating the machine learning models. The data is stored in a CSV file.

### 2. `documentation/`
This folder contains the project proposal.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, scikit, matplotlib, seaborn

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Load the dataset and explore the data using Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts.

3. Train machine learning models to predict sleep quality and stress levels.

4. Use the insights from the model to optimize daily routines for better well-being.
